# Cybersterilizer: Shining a Light on the Future of Healthcare

Cybersterilizer is a medical robotics project developed as a case study for **intelligent sterilization of surgical areas** using dual UV light, with a focus on **automated bacterial load detection** and **precise localized treatment**.

The system is built around a **6-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic robotic arm** equipped with a custom-designed end effector, and is simulated using the **Webots** environment. At its core lies the integration of computer vision (OpenCV + ArUco markers), robotic kinematics (ikpy), and finite state machine control logic.

## üß† Main Features

### üîç Automatic Area Detection

* ArUco marker recognition (DICT\_4X4\_250) to define the treatment area.
* Dynamic generation of a **virtual grid** of cells to process.

### üß¨ Bacterial Detection and Targeted Sterilization

* Activation of **UV-A light** to detect bacteria via fluorescence.
* Upon detection, activation of germicidal **UV-C light**.

### üß© Kinematics and Navigation

* Use of the **Denavit-Hartenberg convention** to describe the robot.
* **Kinematics solver** based on the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse.

### üí° Computer Vision and Control

* Marker extraction with `cv2.aruco.detectMarkers()`.
* Bacteria detection with `cv2.findContours()` on HSV masks.

### üíª User Interaction

* Keyboard input (simulation): start, confirm, emergency stop.
* Live display of grids and detected bacterial contours.
